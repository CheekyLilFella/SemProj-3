            <h2>Depth of marianer trench</h2>
            <p> The Mariana Trench or Marianas Trench is located in the western Pacific Ocean about 200 kilometres (124 miles) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 miles) in length and 69 km (43 miles) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 feat; 6.825 ± 0.016 miles) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep. If Mount Everest were hypothetically placed into the trench at this point, its peak would still be underwater by more than 2 kilometres (1.2 miles).</p>
